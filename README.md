# Introduction

Firstly, thank you for taking the time to look over the contents of my portfolio repository. One of the things I struggled with as a hiring manager in the past was getting an idea of a candidates technical capability from their CV alone, so I'm hoping by showcasing some simpler tasks here like data scraping, importing, cleansing, analysis and visualisation it will help my application stand out a little bit.

<br>

In this repository you will find a plain-text version of my CV and different projects that I've published here too. The repository is broken down into xxxx sections;

1. [My CV](Ben_Cassidy_CV.md)
2. [Telephony Data Project](#telephony-data-project) (Python, SQL & Power BI)
3. [Lottery Numbers Project](#lottery-numbers-project) (Python)
4. [Sudoku Puzzle Project](#sudoku-puzzle-project) (Python)

<br>

# Telephony Data Project

Largest project in this repository at the time, here I'm firstly using python to create dummy call data and storing this in a csv. Then this csv file is queried using python to show top level performance metrics, and also modelled to create another csv file that is used as a data source in Power BI.

For good measure as well, the dummy data csv that has been created is also read into a dataframe and queried using SQL with some Matplotlib visuals thrown in too.

More info can be found in the project readme [Telephony README](telephony_data/README_telephony.md)

# Lottery Numbers Project
For this project I wanted to be able to pull some data from a website and decided to go with the Lottery results page.

Script here looks at downloading the latest results, appending these to a list of results that have been pulled so far, then showing you the most common main numbers to have been drawn (including some potential prize values to).

More project info can be found here [Lottery README](lottery_numbers/README_lottery.md) (IN PROGRESS!)

# Sudoku Puzzle Project

A fun python project that I keep jumping in and out of, in it's current state you can use this script to generate a sudoku puzzle and the solution to go along with it. Still some work to do on this, as I'd like to include the ability to toggle whether the solution is shown when the puzzle is generated and also be able to change how many numbers are removed from the puzzle.

Longer term I would like to build onto this to be a sudoku puzzle solver that will work against an imported image. More info can be found in the [Sudoku README](sudoku_puzzle/README_sudoku.md) (IN PROGRESS!).
